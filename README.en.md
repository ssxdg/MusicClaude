# 诗云 · Poetry Cloud

[中文](README.md) · **English**

### Three thousand years of Chinese poetry, placed into a roamable 3D galaxy.<br/>Every poet is a star, every poem has its own coordinate — and the void between stars is *every possible poem*.

*Inspired by Liu Cixin's «Poetry Cloud» and Borges' «Library of Babel»: poems aren't stored — give a number and it computes which poem it is, and vice versa.*

## What is this

**32,657 poets and 933,857 poems** — all of Chinese poetry through history, placed into a 3D galaxy. The name and idea come from Liu Cixin's short story «Poetry Cloud» (诗云), about a super-civilization that tries to *write every possible poem by brute force*. I borrowed its name for this one.

Each poet is a star; every poem has its own spatial coordinate. You can zoom and fly through the whole sky, click any star to read a poem, and trace the network of who dedicated poems to whom. From the *Book of Songs* to the modern era — three thousand years of poetry in one universe. **Li Bai is a very bright star, but most of it is people you've never heard of, each holding their own coordinate.**

And the **void** between stars holds something bigger still — it is *every possible regulated-verse poem*. Click empty space and a poem is `unrank`ed out of the noise, shown with its **82–229-digit** address in the "complete catalog" — an address nearly as long as the poem itself (the catalog *is* the library). Poems aren't stored; give a number and it computes which poem it is, and vice versa — masterpieces are just measure-zero bright spots in a sea of noise.

> 🖥 **The desktop experience is the most complete.** Mobile works (touch roaming + adaptive quality), but flying, picking and the relationship graph feel best with a big screen and a mouse.

## What it can do

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| **All dynasties + modern verse** | 先秦 (pre-Qin) → present, 15 concentric dynasty shells, filterable; includes **modern free verse** (徐志摩's «再别康桥», 海子, 北岛, 顾城, 戴望舒…; free forms folded into "other"). |
| **Five forms** | 5/7-char quatrains & regulated verse, plus **free-form / 词** (variable line lengths — the line breaks are part of the number too); a **格律 toggle** roams only the tonally-valid sub-catalog. |
| **Search by any line** | Type *any* line (not just openings) → which real poet it belongs to (疑是地上霜 → 李白's «静夜思», a non-first line still resolves), plus the **half-number** that line pins in the random catalog. |
| **Reverse lookup by number** | `unrank` a long number back to its poem, check the line index and full text, and find out whether that number maps to a *real* poem — the catalog↔poem loop, full untruncated numbers, one-click copy. |
| **Dedication network** | Titles (寄/赠/和/次韵…) plus ~250 courtesy-name aliases (少陵→杜甫, 子瞻→苏轼, 香山→白居易…) parsed into **4,849** arcs, bundled toward the galactic core with a soft pulse flowing giver→receiver. |
| **Shareable permalinks** | `#a=<poetId>` / `#p=<form>.<number>`; a 🔗 button on every poem and poet panel rebuilds the poem and restores the view on load. |
| **Fully static** | All index math + rendering run client-side; the server only serves files — **no backend, ever** (the one optional backend is anonymous feedback collection). |

**Three pull modes to feel it:** pure random「牛蝛茙漂綵」→ tonal「趰㵎憣烔岆」→ tonal + common-chars「思伦要锁馆」; plus free-form 词-like variable lines, and "search by line" to find a real poem from one line.

## The idea behind it

Poetry Cloud doesn't store poems — it stores a **bijection**. Every regulated-verse poem corresponds to one huge integer; a number reconstructs the exact poem, and a poem computes back to its number (base-N "Babel" radix + mixed-radix-product rank/unrank for tonal forms, scattered through space by a reversible BigInt Feistel permutation). The index engine is **pure TypeScript with zero dependencies**, fully round-trip reversible, unit-tested green.

So "writing every possible poem" isn't a collection — it's a **computation**: every coordinate in the star-sea is a poem, almost all of it noise, and once in a while one happens to be Li Bai. The real poems by real poets are the named, lit-up points within that sea of noise.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # dev preview (Vite)
npm test         # engine round-trip + data-loading unit tests
npm run build    # typecheck + static build → dist/
```

> Node 20+. Stack: **Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + three.js / @react-three (fiber · drei · postprocessing) + zustand**.

The repo ships the lightweight data (galaxy, author search, tonal rules, half-numbers and the dedication network all work out of the box); the **full per-poem text** and the **line-search index** are large derived datasets (git-ignored) — regenerate them from open corpora per [docs/PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md) when needed. Full static-hosting guide in **[docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md)** (note: `poems/*.json` must be served RAW — the HTTP Range slicing depends on it).

## About

Poetry Cloud is a **vibecoding** project: I ([Cohen](https://cohenjikan.com)) designed and steered the direction, while the main code skeleton and iteration were written by **Claude** — the repo keeps the full human-AI development diary intact ([docs/DEVLOG.md](docs/DEVLOG.md) and [docs/devlog/](docs/devlog/)).

It has earned **~600,000 likes** across Douyin / Xiaohongshu / Bilibili, and is one of a series of my **non-commercial, open-source** projects. The code is MIT — learn from it, self-host it, remix it. Only the poem corpora (especially modern/contemporary texts) remain the copyright of their authors; please don't use them commercially.
